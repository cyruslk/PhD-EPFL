### **2022-02-23 - 3PM - Meeting with Jérôme, EPFL**

"*La recherche création...faire des projets et écrire sur ces projets...tu ne t'es pas lancé dans quelque chose de facile!*"

**Cyrus: Introduction about my design works**

- I'm interested in showing and <u>making visible tensions of the internet</u>, between the cloud and the (explicitely) material; creating networks|infrastructures where the digital, the analog and the physical are intertwined and are placed in a feedback loop/<u>stack</u>/chain of protocols
- I'm Interested in creating design situations and provocations in order to debunk the 'acosmical' illusion of the internet; explore how the internet is both new and old at the same time; temporal although choped into a myriad of micro/schizoïd/disconnected temporalities; explicitely material although flowing and optimized for user interface/experience
- I'm interested in developing what I for the lack of a better word for now frame as <u>applied media archeology</u>, retracing genealogies of the internet temporality through the use of 'discarded electronics' (Hertz)
- Tension as a method; as a frame of action
- Highjacking narratives; Hacking the cloud narrative (cloud representation is then selected) by inserting embodied discourses that contradict with the way it is presented.
  - Highlight: three projects
    - Twitter as the cloud -- <u>The 2X</u> -- a dial-up modem fake news machine, retrieving news provider (e.g: BBC, CNN) tweet streams and simultaneously transmitting them into dial-up signals at the same baud rate; which will in turn intertwine both sources. Then the intertwined analog signal is converted to digital data and uploaded to Twitter at every 260 characters. The iteration #2 of this project adds at the end of each generated tweets the # of these randomly chosen source as an attempt to disrupt these orignal 'flows', breaking the way they works in order to alter their transparency.
    - Mouse events as the cloud - the <u>MODEM_POINTER</u> - the dial-up modem is used here to transmit mouse coordinates to analog signals and back to digital; making these micro-temporalities audible; and playing with the required temporality these audio signals require - which is turns create delays and disruptions in the browsing experience and flow.
    - Cloud as iPhone - the <u>i5VDIRT</u>- network of earth batteries tapping into the electricity of the soil to collect the required amount of voltages | amps to (very slowly) charge an iphone. 

​	**Jérôme: General notes on the research direction**

- There's a tendency in research/creation to approch technology in an autonomous way - as an entity by itself, an entity that has 'agency'. Cyrus: this is something I'm interested in debunking as well.

- Research/creation projects on technology sometimes seem <u>disembodied</u> from humans;

  - what is the role of humans inside the cloud? How do humans contribute to operating and feeding the cloud? 
  - Specific to research/creation: 
    - What is the role of artists?
    - What is the role of design users?

- The preliminary research on the materiality of the cloud (as emerging from the earth rather than being 'cloudy') falls into a binary approach between the atmospheric and the earth; the two opposites -- <u>What (materiality of the cloud) is in-between?</u>

- There's a grammar of in-between actors, states, stakeholders, <u>human makers of the cloud</u>

  - The role of miners extracting cobalt, zinc, ex; make a field work with miners? 
  - The role of micro-actions of users - a grammar of human gestures feeding|operating the cloud?

  **Jérôme: Methods**

- Find a way to contextualise and connect the design work with the text; going back to this disembodied approach when only showing artworks or representations (e.g: text, images, text, images) -- find a way to connect|contextualise these design prototypes with situations that are experienced, feeled; and with theoretical references|context?

- Approach the thesis as an object that embodies different research angles and tones in space|time - a tone that is more academic in dynamic with a research/creation tone. Same for methods: discursive methods as well as practice-based ones. 

  **Cyrus: Methods**

- Interested in working within a repository (of repositories, projects?) where I can create archives of my processes and then cite them in my rationales; With Github - possibility to cite commits as sharable links, possibility to work with branches as project's potentials and aborted design embodiments; possibility to centralize and use issues in order to create dialogues between Nicolas, Jérôme and my notes.

- In short, keeping a diary of:

  - My thesis process and post-meetings compte rendu in the main repository
  - My writing diary about my field of research in the main repository (different MD file name) - references, notes on readings, artists, etc.
  - My project's rationales (md files, branches, issues) <u>in child repositories</u>
  - I want both to be connected and used as research material for research/creation citations along my thesis;
